WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS TUTORIAL

1. How to see the type of a variable or an object
type(name_of_variables)

For example:
x = 1
print(type(x))
-> int

2. Method (. operator)
Example: .upper()

3. Initializing Method
    def __init__(self, arguments):
        pass

4. Inheritance

5. Class Attributes
Class Attributes are attributes that are specific to a class, not to an instance or object of that class.

6. Static Method
